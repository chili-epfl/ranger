Instructions to connect via Bluetooth to Ranger2
================================================

Let consider `BT_ADDRESS` is the Bluetooth address of the robot (`hcitool scan`
can help you with that):

- `export BT_ADDRESS='10:00:E8:6C:F0:4F'`

And `HCI` is the Bluetooth interface you want to use (typically,
`hci0`).

- `export HCI='hci0'`

Initial pairing
---------------

The first time you connect to the robot, you need to perform an initial
pairing:

- `echo "0000" | bluez-simple-agent $HCI $BT_ADDRESS`

Creating a serial port
----------------------

- `sudo rfcomm -i $HCI bind 0 $BT_ADDRESS`

This creates a new serial device: `/dev/rfcomm0`

Connect to the robot's Aseba network
------------------------------------

Either:

- `asebamedulla -d -v "ser:device=/dev/rfcomm0;fc=hard;baud=921600"`

or simply:

- `asebaswitch -d -v "ser:device=/dev/rfcomm0;fc=hard;baud=921600"`

Closing the connection
----------------------

- `ctrl+C` to quit `asebamedulla` or `asebaswitch`, and then:

- `sudo rfcomm release 0` to release the serial port.

- ./scenario1.py

Troubleshooting
---------------

- slow, erratic behavior -> likely due to poor bt signal. Find a better bt adapter!
- asebamedulla blocks on "presence from 0 : protocol version 4"
   -> data corruption
      - general solution: retry as many times as required
      - also: prevent `modem-manager` to interfere by moving it away (`/usr/sbin/modem-manager`)
